# My-Projects

This is a repository of all coding projects I have worked on over the past several years. It includes the following:
- Quantum chaos internship with Professor Brian Swingle (MATLAB, .m)
- LiDAR based Collision Avoidance System for bicycles (Arduino files, .ino)
- Complex plane conformal mapping visualisation (Python: 'Complex Graph Trial 1.py')
- 3-sided coin mechanical simulation (JavaScript, .js)
- GMAT mission trajectory (Hohmann Transfer copied)
- COVID hotspot mapping project (R, .r)
- Quantum wavefunction simulations (Python: 'Dissipative Psi.py', 'Wavefunction Animation 1.0.py')
- XCode Apps (Swift, .swift)
